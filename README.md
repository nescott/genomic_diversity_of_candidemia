# Genomic and Phenotypic Diversity of Candidemia Isolates in the Twin Cities Metro Area

This repo contains scripts used for analysis of candidemia isolates collected from five Twin Cities area hospitals between 2019 and 2021.

Scripts in the candidemia_species_phenotyping directory were used for chapter 2 of my dissertation, scripts in the Candida_albicans directory were used for chapter 3, and scripts in the Candida_glabratat directory were used for chapter 4.
