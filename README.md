# Genomic and Phenotypic Diversity of Candidemia Isolates in the Twin Cities Metro Area

This repo contains scripts used for analysis of candidemia isolates prospectively collected from a Minnesota hospital system between 2019 and 2021. Each directory represents the analyses performed for a chapter of my doctoral disseration. 

The candidemia_species_phenotyping directory summarizes phenotyping data for 289 unique isolates from 11 *Candida* species. 

The Candida_albicans directory contains scripts used to analyze whole genome sequencing data from 100 *C. albicans* isolates collected by our study as well as publicly available sequencing data for 199 additional isolates. 

Scripts in the Candida_glabrata directory were used for WGS analysis of 98 *C. glabrata* isolates from our study and publicly available sequences of 100 additional isolates.
